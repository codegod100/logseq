- I read [[meditations on moloch]] for [[node club]] by [[alan gingsberg]]
- moloch kinda reminds me of the machine in [[bolo'bolo]]
- we are all moloch, moloch is the apparatus, moloch is not a person.
- What does the [[death of moloch]] look like?
- how do we kill moloch without killing ourselves
