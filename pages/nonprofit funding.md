- Nonprofits can fund their work with sponsorships, grants, individual giving, events, fee-for-service, and more.
## Sponsorships
	- Sponsorships allow nonprofits to partner with other reputable organizations to receive funds and in-kind donations.
	- Usually, this comes in the form of public thanks and displaying the sponsor’s logo
	- For example, grocery stores and restaurants might be interested in sponsoring a nonprofit fighting hunger.
## Individual donations
	- "donate now" button
	- [[peer to peer fundraising]]
	- Major donors are a special category of individual donors. These are supporters with the financial means to give more than most. Each nonprofit defines major gifts differently. For a small nonprofit, $250 might be a major gift, while a larger organization may define it as gifts of $5,000 or more
		- The process of courting and retaining major donors is often called “[[Moves Management]].”
