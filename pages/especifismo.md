- Especifismo is considered to have come to broadly similar conclusions to the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) and may be considered to be very similar to [[platformism]][citation needed], which in turn claims its roots lie in the organisational work of figures like Mikhail Bakunin, Errico Malatesta and [[Nestor Makhno]].
- [[social insertion]]
	- the oppressed are the most revolutionary sector of society, and that the seed of the future revolutionary transformation of society lies already in these classes and social groupings
	- anarchist involvement in the [[daily fights of the oppressed]] and working classes

- key concepts
	- The need for specifically anarchist organization built around a unity of ideas and praxis.
	- The use of the specifically anarchist organization to theorize and develop strategic political and organizing work.
	- Active involvement in and building of autonomous and popular social movements, which is described as the process of “social insertion.”
- The Especifists put forward three main thrusts to their politics, the first two being on the level of organization. By raising the need for a specifically anarchist organization built around a unity of ideas and praxis, the Especifists inherently state their objection to the idea of a synthesis organization of revolutionaries or multiple currents of anarchists loosely united.
	- The result of these types of union are libertarian collectives without much more in common than considering themselves anarchists
	- North American anarchists have also offered their experiences of synthesis organization as lacking any cohesiveness due to multiple, contradictory political tendencies
- Without a strategy that stems from common political agreement, revolutionary organizations are bound to be an affair of reactivism against the continual manifestations of oppression and injustice and a cycle of fruitless actions to be repeated over and over
- Especifists criticize these tendencies for being driven by spontaneity and individualism and for not leading to the serious, systematic work needed to build revolutionary movements
- trust within the members and groups is built that allows for a deep, high-level discussion of their action.
	- might lead to interesting discussions on federated [[trust]] and [[identity]]
- It must have as a foundation the experience of the [[struggle of the oppressed]] and their aspirations, and from those elements it must set the goals and the tasks to be followed by the [[revolutionary organization]] in order to succeed not only in the final objective but also in the immediate ones.
- [[the platform]]
	- The authors of the Platform were veteran partisans of the Russian Revolution. They helped lead a peasant guerilla war against Western European armies and later the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, whose people had a history independent of the Russian Empire
