	- >I'm sorry to announce that we'll deprecate the GitHub integration once the mobile app is working, as a small team we have to focus on the core editor UX and more reliable storage options.  The mobile app might be ready for testing in 1~2 months.
	- >For people who still need the GitHub integration, we will open source our existing backend code this month so that you can self-host yourself.
	- hopefully there will be a plugin to use git when they decide to do this or I might go back to [[obsidian]] I'll keep y'all posted
